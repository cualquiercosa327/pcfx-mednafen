# Remove ACCURATE paths - DONE

# Add 16-bits output support - DONE
This should run faster on hardware that runs faster on 16-bits surfaces.

# Remove dot clock emulation mode - DONE

# Remove Virtual Boy specific code - DONE (?)

# Remove more junk that steals cycles - DONE
We pretty much removed everything that could slow it. Now the profilter says that what's
slowing down the emulator is the CPU core itself :(

# Remove libtrio
Why is this a thing ? It's not even maintained anymore, except by Mednafen of course...
We need to switch to using the C library instead and remove those that we can't switch (like trio_aprintf but we need to be careful about that)

# Remove tests
They are useful for checking Mednafen and whetever it would crash or not.
Maybe put it behind a DEBUG flag ?

# Make it mono-threaded, rather than multi-threaded
The only thread stuff that is left is cdromif.cpp, which uses a thread for CD stuff.
This would need to be fixed for better portability against platforms without pthread.

#Â Fix frameskipping
It doesn't seem to work at all for PC-FX...

# Remove C++ exceptions and/or eventually switch to C
Mednafen extensively uses C++ exceptions so it might be difficult but it would be the first step towards a C codebase. 
We could not care about handling exceptions and assume everything goes fine but that wouldn't be the proper way to do it.
I guess that's the last thing i would want to work on given how spread out it is.
